# stm_add - Start-Menu Add
> stm_add is a CLI written in Rust to create .desktop files for a Linux Operating System.

Sometimes software is released in formats that are executable, but not integrated into your system, for example .x86_64 or .AppImage, requiring the user to call it through the terminal. The stm_add is a small cli app that integrates these executables properly into your linux system following it's standards.
